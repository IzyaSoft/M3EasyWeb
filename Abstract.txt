This tiny web server was taken from the 'Design & Elektronik'
extra issue 'Embedded Internet'. It can be downloaded from the 
following web site: www.elektroniknet.de/extraheft. 

This software was adapted to work with a Keil MCB1700 board and 
the Keil RV ARM C-Compiler with as few modifications as possible. 

Note that modifications are not optimal, because ARM is a 32-bit 
machine while the original software was written for 16-bit cpu.

The web page shows the values of two analog inputs (AN0 and AN1).
This tiny webserver needs very little resources and therefore has
some restrictions:
- only one active TCP session at any one time
- no support for fragmented IP datagrams
- no buffer for TCP datagrams received in wrong order
- only one web page. No GIF/JPG graphics possible.

The IP address can be modified in the module tcpip.h to
fit into your existing LAN (see MYIP_x). 
Please order the extra issue 'Embedded Internet' of the 
'Design & Elektronik' magazine for a technical description.
It is only available in German language. 

The easyWEB project is set up for one target:
  MCB1700:  Settings for Keil MCB1700 Board. 
            Program code is loaded into on-chip flash

Note: check correct settings for jumper E/C and jumper E/U


以太网测试程序。
使用方法： 插上JP6 跳线 和JP12跳线
在IE上输入192.168.0.100 显示一些板子信息和AD采样电压
调节VR1 可以看到电压值变化
